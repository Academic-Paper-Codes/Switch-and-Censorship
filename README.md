# Switch-based-Web-3.0-Censorship-System
* This is a blockchain project written in Python, which contains multiple modules for managing blockchain transactions, miner operations, user data, etc. Multiple Python scripts are used in the project to implement core functions, including transaction pool management, blockchain data processing, user key management, etc.

## Project Structure
* blockchain_data.json: JSON file storing blockchain data.
* main.py: project entry, executes the main logic.
* Miner.py: Implement miner-related operations, such as block mining.
* Record.py: handles operations related to blockchain records.
* Redaction.py: Used to handle the deletion or anonymization of sensitive data.
* Regisration.py: User registration module.
* Setup.py: Project initialization configuration module.
* TransactionPool.py: Transaction pool module, used to manage and process transaction requests.
* UserKeyReturning.py: Module that handles user key recovery.
* transaction_data.json: JSON file storing transaction data.
* user_data.json: JSON file that stores user data.

## Configuration
* Make sure you have correctly configured all the configuration files required by the project, especially the JSON files such as blockchain_data.json and transaction_data.json, which contain the data of the blockchain and transactions.

## How to run
* Run the main.py file directly: python main.py
